# Procurement-System
his project is based on the concept of Demand and Supply and is named Procurement System as it basically works for industrial factories and Assembly Plants where a raw material is ‘Procured’ from other places and industries and is then used for further producing objects like cars, buses, etc… The concept is equally applicable for e-commerce purposes where the user may place an order and then it is verified by the platforms( Flipkart, Amazon, etc)  and then forwarded to their respective suppliers.
